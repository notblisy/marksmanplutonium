For spells that are ranged or melee spell attacks, you use Dex+Proficiency to hit for the Ranged Weapon Attack, and if the spell spawns multiple projectiles on hit, you use Int+Proficiency to hit for those.

",
				"Example. You cast Scorching Ray as a second level spell as your first attack action. You roll an 18+Dex, and it hits. You deal 1d8+Dex Weapon Die damage, then the 2d6 fire damage from One Scorching Ray. After that, the two other Scorching rays fly off and you choose two more targets, rolling to hit using your Intelligence Modifier. ",
				"Saving Throw Spells. Your saving throw DC is 8+Intelligence+Proficiency. The way these spells work is that if the bullet collides with a target, then the spell activates and if saving throws are required, they are then made. If it is an area of effect spell, the point / face nearest to its collision is its origin point, and line spells start at said target and continue in a line behind that target at the angle they were shot from. This means you can miss saving throw spells and waste those spell slots. You may shoot inanimate objects or allies if need be to start the area of effect. ",
				" Example. You cast Shatter as a 2nd level spell. Your attack roll is an 18+6, and you hit. You deal 1d8+Dex damage, then your shatter spell explodes out at the point of impact. The creatures within range, including the one you hit with the attack, must attempt the saving throw for Shatter. ",
				" Non-Damaging Spells. Casting spells that deal no damage work as described above. If you wish to cast a targeted spell, you must first hit the target with an attack roll, and then said target make must the required saving throws / if there is none the spell effect is applied. If it is an area of effect spell, the point / face nearest to its collision is its origin point. ",
				" Other Cases. If a spell takes longer or less time than 1 action to cast, you may not cast it. You may also not cast spells as a ritual. Reaction spells may not be cast. Concentration works as normal. ",
				" Spells Learned from Other Sources. Spells learned from Multiclassing, feats, racial, or any non Gun Mage source may be cast normally without your Firearm. These spells learned from outside of this class may only be from your Firearm if they are written into your spellbook, and your spells from this class may not be cast through means other than your Firearm.
